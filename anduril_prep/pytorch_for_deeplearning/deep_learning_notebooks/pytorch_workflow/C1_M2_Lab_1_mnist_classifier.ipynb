    "## MNIST Dataset: Preparing your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MNIST dataset](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html) is a classic benchmark for image classification and is often considered the “hello world” of computer vision. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28 by 28 pixels, in grayscale, showing a single handwritten digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a model can learn from this data, you need to convert the images into numbers that a neural network can process. Each pixel becomes a numerical value representing its brightness, and together these numbers form a **tensor**, which is the format PyTorch models use for computation. Neural networks train best when these input values are small and centered around zero because that helps gradients flow more smoothly and makes learning more stable. To achieve this, you will **normalize** the pixel values so they fall within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see exactly what this means, you’ll start by loading the MNIST training data directly from `torchvision`, PyTorch’s library for computer vision tasks. You won’t apply any transformations yet. Instead, you’ll inspect a raw image to see what the data looks like before any changes, and later compare how that same image appears once it’s been prepared for the model.\n",

    "    * As you saw in the lectures, it is essential for the model and the data to be on the same device to prevent errors. In this notebook, you'll handle this inside the training function itself. By moving both the model and the data to the `device` within that function, you guarantee they are correctly placed right before any computations happen.\n",
    ">\n",
    "* **The Loss Function**: You'll use <code>[nn.CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)</code> as your loss function. This is the standard choice for multi-class classification tasks like MNIST because it is specifically designed to measure the error when a model has to choose one class from several possibilities (i.e., one digit from 0-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Optimizer**: You'll use <code>[optim.Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html)</code>, a popular and highly effective optimizer. The optimizer's job is to update the model's weights to minimize the loss. `Adam` is known for adapting the learning rate as it trains, which often helps the model learn more quickly and reliably than other optimizers."
